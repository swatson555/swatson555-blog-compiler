title: Studying Japanese - The Results
abstract: This report documents my systematic method used to achieve the JLPT N3 proficiency level over a three-year period. The entire study was structured as an applied process of inquiry, where three core principles regarding skill development were tested against external proficiency scores. This document outlines the methodology, verifies the core assumptions, and presents the final quantitative results, confirming that a focused, evidence-based strategy efficiently guides the learner to the high intermediate level.

## Studying Japanese

The entire study plan was defined by three **Foundational Hypotheses** that governed resource selection and pacing. Establishing these parameters provided the necessary focus for the efficient use of study time.

The three primary assumptions that governed this study were:

1.  **Phonetics First:** The **phonetic nature** of the language must be prioritized above all other aspects of its study to ensure mastery of the underlying structure and inflections.
2.  **Long-Term Listening:** The development of advanced listening comprehension requires significant time and passive exposure, estimated at up to **five years**.
3.  **Dictionary is Key:** Mastery of the **authentic Japanese-Japanese dictionary** is the single most important goal, signifying the transition from translation reliance to **study independence**.

The second assumption allowed for the sensible amortization of study effort, reducing pressure for immediate listening gains. The third ensured study time was invested in acquiring a skill essential for **scholarly independence** in the language.


## Testing

Consistent external verification was critical for tracking progress and confirming the outcome against the target JLPT N3 level. The following test scores confirm the efficacy of my systematic method.

| Evaluation Tool | Date | Score / Placement | Correlated Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **italki Language Test** | Nov 2023 | 2.9 | JLPT N3 / CEFR A2 |
| **italki Language Test** | Jun 2024 | 3.7 | JLPT N3 / CEFR A2 (Improved) |
| **San Jose Learning Center** | June 2024 | 8–12 Placement | JLPT N4 |
| **Busuu Certificates** | July 2024 | Passed A1 and A2 | JLPT N3 (Consistent Baseline) |
| **Kotoba Discord Bot** | Ongoing | Consistent Pass | JLPT N3 |

The consistent results across these measurement tools are used for comparative verification of the target proficiency level.


## Resource Analysis and Vocabulary Acquisition

The primary acquisition of grammar and formal vocabulary was guided by a sequential approach using two specific textbook series, complemented by skill-building software and dictionary use.

### Textbook Resource Analysis

| Textbook Series | Target Level | Primary Focus | Vocabulary & Kanji Count |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ***Genki*** (Vols. 1 & 2) | JLPT N5 / N4 (CEFR A1) | Foundational Grammar & Culture | **1,700 words** & **317 kanji** |
| ***Quartet*** (Vols. 1 & 2) | JLPT N3 / N2 (CEFR A2 / B1) | Intermediate Grammar & Academic Concepts | **1,600 words** & **657 kanji** |
| **Combined Total** | N3 Achievement | N/A | **3,300 words** & **974 kanji** |

The **Genki series** established the foundational grammar, while the **Quartet series** introduced intermediate concepts and shifted the focus toward academic discourse. This sequence provided a complete path from beginner to intermediate. The combined vocabulary total aligns closely with the expected lexical requirements for the N3 level.

### Skill Building and Independent Tools

The **Duolingo Japanese course** served as the engine for skill building and practical vocabulary memorization, teaching up to a **JLPT N3 standard** with about **3,500** words. Its application-heavy structure complemented the comprehensive grammar rules provided by the textbooks. 

Furthermore, the goal of using **Japanese-Japanese dictionaries** (*Daijisen* and *Daijirin*) was successfully achieved. The ability to navigate these native-language dictionaries, despite their initial difficulty, exemplified the principle that this skill is essential for moving past rudimentary study and achieving genuine **advanced comprehension** and **study independence**.


## Conclusion

The successful attainment of **JLPT N3 proficiency** was a direct result of adhering to **my chosen structured framework**, with all supporting evidence consistently pointing to the achieved level.

The final acquisition metrics were:

* **Lexemes Memorized:** $\sim 4,000$

* **Kanji Characters Memorized:** $\sim 1,000$

* **Achieved Proficiency:** JLPT N3

This structured methodology, completed in approximately three years, verified the initial hypotheses and efficiently **resulted in the development of my proficiency**, reaching the specific metrics listed above.
